# Problem-solving process
1. ask a lot of questions
* walking through examples  
**repeat until you fully understand**
* build a naive solution (no need to clever)
* Test it (meanwhile brief the solution to interviewer)
 * normal input
 * edge input
 * data structure
 * performance
 * trade-offs  
 ex: more memory to speedup
* iterate design & analysis to come up with candidate solution
* **implement it**
